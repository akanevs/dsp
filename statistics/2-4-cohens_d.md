[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> 

#Histograms are shown.

#First babies: We can see in the figure that the distribution is roughly normal (Gaussian),
#with a mode of 7.5lb, and a tail that extends farther to the left than the right. The mean
#is 7.2lb, variance is 2.02 and standard deviation is 1.42.

#For others, the distribution is again roughly normal with a mode of 7.0lb, and a tail
#that extends farther to the left than to the right. The mean is 7.33lb, the variance
#is 1.94 and the standard deviation is 1.39. Even though the mode is smaller than for
#the first born case, there are also very high frequency of babies with weights between
#7 and 8 pounds.

#For the pregnancy length, the Cohen distance is 0.029 standard deviations, which is
#quite small, while for the birth weight, the Cohen distance is -0.089, which is quite
#a bit larger but still small.

#In this example, the difference in means is 0.029 standard deviations, which
#is small.  To put that in perspective,  the difference in height between men
#and women is about 1.7 standard deviations (see
