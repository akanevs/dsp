[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The distribution generated by the random number generator does look quite uniform as can be seen
on both the PMF (1c.png in img folder) and CDF (1d.png) plots. The CDF for a truly uniform
distribution is a straight line, and the CDF curve we get looks "nearly" straight. The mean we get
(0.50044847923) is also quite close to the true value 0.5 . As the size of the random array grows
larger, the resulting CDF curve should be even "straighter" as can be seen in 1e.png (array of 40000 
random numbers).

Code:

array = 1.0*np.random.random(1000)
    
df = pandas.DataFrame(array)
#print(df[0])

#random numbers between 0 and 1
hist = thinkstats2.Hist(df[0])

# plot histogram
#thinkplot.Hist(hist)
#thinkplot.Show(xlabel='value', ylabel='frequency')

# construct PMF
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(hist)

# plot PMF
thinkplot.PrePlot(1)
thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf])
#thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Number of children u18yrs', ylabel='PMF')
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Value of random number', ylabel='PMF',width=0.10)

print('Actual mean', pmf.Mean())

# computer CDF
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(pmf, label='array')

# plot CDF
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Value', ylabel='CDF')
